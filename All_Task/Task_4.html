Tag:--
A tag is a fundamental building block in HTML.
Tags are used to define and encapsulate different parts of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < >.
They are often used in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the closing tag having a forward slash / before the tag name.
Tags define the beginning and end of an HTML element.
Tags are not visible to users in the web browser; they are used to structure and format the content on the page.
Example of tags:

Opening tag: <h1> (defines a level 1 heading)
Closing tag: </h1>

  
Element:--
An element is created by a pair of tags: an opening tag and a closing tag, which enclose content.
Elements consist of both the tags and the content they surround.
Elements can be nested, meaning you can have one element inside another.
Elements define the structure and content of the web page.
Example of an element:


<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
<p> is the opening tag.
</p> is the closing tag.
"This is a paragraph element." is the content enclosed by the tags.
Together, the tags and content create a p element that defines a paragraph on the web page.
Here's a more complete example using multiple tags and elements in HTML:


  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
</body>
</html>
In this example:

<html> and </html> define the HTML document.
<head> and </head> enclose metadata about the document, including the page title.
<body> and </body> define the main content of the web page.
<h1> and </h1> define a top-level heading.
<p> and </p> define a paragraph.
<a> and </a> create a hyperlink.
<img> defines an image, with src for the image source and alt for alternative text.
