Explain:-Comments in HTML are used to provide non-visible information or notes within the HTML code. They are not displayed in the web browser and are primarily intended for developers to include explanations, reminders, or documentation about the code. Comments can help make your HTML code more understandable for you and other developers who might work on the same project.

In HTML, comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags. Anything placed between these tags is considered a comment and is ignored by the browser when rendering the web page.
